</div>

FRED (Fraud Recognition & Easy Detection) is a Chrome extension that helps you analyze emails and text for potential fraud or phishing attempts using OpenAI's powerful language models. It's designed with privacy in mind - your content never reaches our servers, as analysis happens directly between your browser and OpenAI using your personal API key.

## üîç Features

- **Email Analysis**: Examines Gmail email content, sender details, and formatting for fraud indicators
- **Text Analysis**: Analyze any pasted text for potential scams or suspicious content
- **Threat Rating**: Provides a 1-10 scale threat assessment with color-coded risk levels
- **Detailed Explanations**: Explains why content might be suspicious with specific reasoning
- **Fraud Indicators**: Highlights specific elements that triggered warnings
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your content is only shared with OpenAI, never stored on our servers
- **User-Supplied API Key**: Use your own OpenAI API key (no subscription to us required)
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-understand tabbed interface with clear visual indicators

## üîë Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key

This extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. Your API key is stored locally on your device and is only used to communicate with OpenAI.

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. Click "Create new secret key" and copy the key
4. Open the Gmail Fraud Detector extension in Gmail
5. Click the "Settings" button
6. Paste your API key and click "Save API Key"

**Note**: Using OpenAI's API will incur charges based on your usage. The extension uses GPT-3.5 Turbo to minimize costs while providing quality analysis. Check [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates.
