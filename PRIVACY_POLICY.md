# FRED: Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: May 10, 2024

Thank you for using FRED (Fraud Recognition & Easy Detection). This Privacy Policy explains how FRED handles your data and protects your privacy.

## Our Privacy Principles

FRED is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe that protecting your information is of utmost importance. This extension:

1. **Never stores your email content** on our servers
2. **Never collects or transmits your browsing history**
3. **Only sends data to OpenAI** using your own API key
4. **Stores your API key locally** on your device only

## Data Collection and Usage

### What we DO collect/use:

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser's secure storage. It is never transmitted to our servers.
- **Email Content (Temporary)**: When you analyze an email, its content is temporarily processed in memory and sent directly from your browser to OpenAI's API. This data is never stored persistently.
- **Analysis Results**: Fraud detection results are displayed to you but are never saved beyond your current session.

### What we DO NOT collect:

- We do not collect or store any personal information about users
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not use cookies or any other tracking technologies
- We do not collect analytics about your usage of the extension
- We do not store copies of your emails or analyzed content anywhere

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

- **OpenAI**: The only third-party service that may receive your data is OpenAI when you use your API key to analyze content. This transmission happens directly from your browser to OpenAI's servers. Please refer to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for information on how they handle your data.

- **Google**: As a Chrome extension, certain technical information may be available to Google as outlined in their Chrome Web Store policies. We do not separately share data with Google.

## Offline Mode

FRED includes an offline analysis mode that:
- Uses pattern matching on your device only
- Does not transmit any data externally
- Provides basic fraud detection capability without an API key

## Security

We protect your information by:
- Storing sensitive data (like API keys) only in your local browser storage
- Implementing basic obfuscation for stored API keys
- Using secure HTTPS connections for all API communications
- Never transmitting information to our own servers

## Your Rights and Choices

Since we don't collect or store your personal information on our servers, there isn't much to manage. However, you can:

- Delete your API key from local storage at any time through the extension's settings
- Uninstall the extension to remove all locally stored data
- Choose to use offline mode exclusively to avoid transmitting any data to OpenAI

## Changes to This Policy

If we make significant changes to this privacy policy, we will update the policy in the extension and may notify users through the Chrome Web Store listing.
